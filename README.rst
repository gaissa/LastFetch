That's SO last year
===================

Quick and dirty script to get month by month plays from the last.fm API.
I put it up here for reference, rather than as a finished work - most of
the heavy lifting has been done (you don't need to work out the XML, for
example).

Blog post containing my results can be found here: http://www.offmessage.com/2011/01/a-year-in-music/

Installation
------------

You'll need httplib2 installed (either python-httplib2 from apt or use pip/easy_install to install httplib2 from PyPI).

Running
-------

Run the script using::

  python fetcher.py <yourusername>
